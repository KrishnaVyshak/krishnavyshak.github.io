    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sew Mall</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: 01/07/2025</em></p>
  </header>

  <main>
  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: July 1, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>Sew Mall ("we", "us", or "our") respects the privacy of its users ("you", "your") and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Sew Mall mobile application ("App"), which offers digital learning materials, video courses, sewing tutorials, and other educational content. By using our App, you consent to the practices described herein. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you should refrain from accessing or using the App.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use Sew Mall, we may collect several types of data, including but not limited to: (a) personal identification information such as your name, email address, mobile number, and device ID when you register or log in; (b) course access data, including course IDs, purchase or coupon history, timestamps, playback activity, progress tracking, and last access time; (c) device and usage information including IP address, browser type, device manufacturer, OS version, crash logs, and interaction logs such as button taps, screen views, and video engagement; and (d) advertising-related identifiers such as your Google Ad ID which may be used to serve personalized ads via Google AdMob.</p>

  <h2>Course Access, Purchases, and Coupons</h2>
  <p>Courses within the Sew Mall App can be accessed either by redeeming promotional coupons or through direct purchase (currently in development). When a coupon is redeemed, the associated course is permanently linked to the user's account and device. Any future payment-based access will be processed via trusted third-party providers; we will never store sensitive payment data such as credit card numbers. All course activity, including when a course is accessed and how long it was viewed, is logged to monitor fair use and optimize user experience.</p>

  <h2>Anti-Piracy Measures and Content Protection</h2>
  <p>To protect the integrity of our digital content and the rights of creators, Sew Mall embeds a unique, digital watermark into all video streams, tied specifically to the user’s account and device. This measure is designed to trace and discourage screen recordings and illegal distribution of course materials. Users are strictly prohibited from downloading, recording, sharing, redistributing, or reselling any form of content—including videos, PDF patterns, quizzes, or other proprietary material—whether publicly or privately. Any attempts to violate these terms may result in account suspension, revocation of access, and potential legal action.</p>

  <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We partner with Google AdMob to deliver ads within the app. Google AdMob may collect certain data about your device, ad interactions, and general usage for the purpose of showing relevant advertisements. This includes device identifiers, app activity logs, and approximate location. These services operate under their own privacy policies, which we recommend you review at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Policy</a>. You may opt out of personalized advertising through your device’s ad settings.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The data we collect is used to: (a) deliver a personalized learning experience; (b) manage user accounts and support secure authentication; (c) provide customer support and respond to user queries; (d) improve course content, performance, and app features through aggregated insights; (e) serve relevant advertising; (f) detect and prevent fraud, piracy, abuse, or violations of our Terms of Service; and (g) comply with legal obligations and cooperate with lawful investigations when necessary.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. We may share data with trusted partners only when necessary, including Supabase (for secure database and authentication services), Google AdMob (for ads), and analytics services for performance tracking. These third parties are contractually bound to safeguard your data and may not use it for unrelated purposes. Additionally, we may disclose information if required to do so by law, regulation, court order, or if necessary to enforce our legal rights or protect other users.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account remains active or as needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In some cases, data may be retained longer to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes. When data is no longer required, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. You may request to view how your information is used or revoke consent for specific uses. Requests for data access or deletion can be sent to <strong>krishnavyshakr@gmail.com</strong>. We will respond to all reasonable requests within the timeframe required by applicable law. Note that deleting your account or revoking certain data may limit or disable your access to the app’s services.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take the protection of your data seriously. All sensitive information is stored on encrypted servers with restricted access. We employ a combination of encryption protocols, secure access tokens, session validation, and periodic audits to ensure your data remains secure. While we strive to follow best industry practices, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and users accept some risk when using any internet-based service.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Sew Mall is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone in this age group. If we become aware that a user under 13 has registered without verified parental consent, we will delete the associated data and account immediately. Parents or guardians who believe their child has used the app without authorization should contact us promptly.</p>

 <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
  We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time at our discretion. Changes may reflect updates in legal requirements, business practices, feature additions, or security enhancements. While we may notify users of significant changes via the app or email, it is not mandatory, and we are under no obligation to provide individual notice for every update.
</p>
<p>
  Users are responsible for reviewing the Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any modifications. Continued use of the Sew Mall app after any changes to the policy constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of those changes.
